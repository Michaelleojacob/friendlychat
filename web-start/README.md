# Firebase Web Codelab - Start code

This folder contains the starting code for the [Firebase: Build a Real Time Web Chat App Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/).

If you'd like to jump directly to the end and see the finished code head to the [web](../web) directory.

couple key things to note:

had to do .touch firestore.rules to the ./web-start directory

had to .touch storage.rules to the ./web-start directory

security and deployment examples are towards the end of the codelab

Q. do I have to initialize my firebase config in every file? Because the ./web-start/src/firebase-messaging.js needed to be initialized
